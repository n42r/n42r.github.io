Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Nasr.


**At the intersection of data, AI, and systems thinking, Iâ€™m a deep-tech innovator and venture-minded technology leader, passionate about building meaningful innovations â€” and the teams that make them thrive.**

Currently Lead Solutions Architect at PUMA, I bring 10+ years of experience across global enterprises, startups, and international R&D, working at the edge of emerging technologies and strategy. I specialize in translating deep technical insight into product architectures, organizational capability, and long-term business value. 
	
**What I Do:**

1. **Build and lead high-impact digital products & platforms**
	- **[PUMA.com](https://www.puma.com)** â€“ global e-commerce platform
	- **[SIMUTOOL](https://github.com/simutool)** â€“ EU-funded data cataloging SaaS
	- **[Tawla](tw)** â€“ AI-powered iOS board game
	- **[Greetings Studio](gs)** â€“ creative mobile app for visual storytelling

2. **Invent and prototype next-generation Data & AI systems**
	- **Data Strategy & Architecture**
		- **[The Basin Network](phd)** â€“ PhD-awarded data architecture framework 
		- **[Data-sharing markets](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42486-020-00054-y)** â€“ novel frameworks for IoT interoperability
	- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
		- **[AI agents for games](tw)**
		- **[Robotic cognition](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/6006)** and **[Reasoning systems](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16111-7_14)**
		- **[Muze AI](https://github.com/n42r/muze-ai)** â€“ experimental music recommender 

3. **Think beyond the hype â€” and years ahead of the curve**
	- Began working on **AI in 2006** â€” before the boom â€” earning a reputation as "The AI guy" in local technology circles
	
	- Developed a **formal data architecture framework** in 2016 â€” years before "data mesh" and similar concepts gained popularity.

Known for bridging scientific rigor with strategic clarity, I thrive at the convergence of **vision, architecture, and innovation execution** â€” building toward scalable, sustainable impact in data and AI ecosystems.
