**Technical leader (business-wide, product, or team) with background in Architecture (solution, integration, and data architecture). I bring 15 years of experience across global enterprises, startups, and international R&D projects.**

My strength lies in seeing things **holistically** and translating business strategy into product architectures, organizational capability, and long-term business value.
	
**What I Do:**

1. **Build and lead high-impact digital products & platforms**

	- **[Tawla](tw)** – AI-powered iOS board game
	- **[Greetings Studio](gs)** – mobile app for visual storytelling

2. **Invent and prototype** next-generation **Data & AI systems**
	- **[The Basin Network](phd)** – PhD-awarded data architecture framework 
	- **[Data-sharing markets](https://doi.org/10.1007/s42486-020-00054-y)** – novel frameworks for IoT interoperability
