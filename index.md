Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nasr.

Throughout my 15+ years in technology innovation, I have led and executed successful initiatives across AI, data architecture, eâ€‘commerce, robotics, and mobile applications. My experience spans start-ups, global corporate headquarters, and multiâ€‘million Euro publicly funded R&D projects. 

As Lead Solutions Architect at PUMA Global E-Commerce Engineering, I drive organizational strategy and cross-team collaboration. I founded the "Tech Cats of eComm" to advance architectural strategy, innovation, and technical excellence.

At the intersection of organizational strategy and technical leadership, I excel in building high-performing teams and driving cross-functional collaboration to deliver impactful, scalable solutions. Past initiatives include:

- [The Basin Network](phd): Invented a next-generation (post-data mesh) data architecture for data teams to share and remix data across enterprises, earning a PhD and two publications.

- [SIMUTOOL Data Management SaaS](https://github.com/simutool): Led a four-year initiative to build a SaaS that optimized operational efficiency by 30% for a â‚¬3.5M EU-funded aerospace manufacturing consortium.

- Playing a key role in two B2C software products: a mobile game ([Tawla](tw)) and a social network app ([Greetings Studio](gs)).

- Developing Artificial Intelligence players for games and publishing papers on making robots smarter in top AI conferences in the world.

To others Iâ€™m known as an enthusiastic person who is flexible, resilient, and creative. In my free time Iâ€™m a music collector/producer, jogger, and an aspiring yogi.
