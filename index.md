Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nasr.

I'm a dynamic architect, tech lead, and research scientist with a history of guiding successful projects spanning diverse domains (data architecture, AI, robotics, mobile apps, and games) and settings (from agile B2C environments to multiâ€‘million R&D projects).

At the intersection of engineering innovation and product leadership, I excel in delivering state-of-the-art solutions that drive business growth and elevate user experiences. Some noteworthy achievements include:

- Leading the design and development of a [data lake SaaS](https://github.com/simutool) for an [aerospace/automotive consortium](https://doi.org/10.3030/680569).

- Inventing a new approach of data architecture & data mesh ([The Basin Network](phd)), resulting in an award of [a PhD](https://fis.uni-bamberg.de/entities/publication/d28b1f7d-1c85-4214-a80f-69ab40d08b60) with distinction and publications ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42486-020-00054-y) [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13222-018-0274-0)).

- Playing a key role in two B2C software products: a mobile game ([Tawla](tw)) and a social network app ([Greetings Studio](gs)).

- Developing Artificial Intelligence players for games and publishing methods to make robots smarter ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16111-7_14) [[2]](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/6006)).


Iâ€™m experienced with cloud-native system architectures (stateless nodes, ...). My technical proficiencies include Python, Linux CLI, Docker, MongoDB, Neo4j, MySQL, and Google Firebase Cloud.

To others Iâ€™m known as an enthusiastic person who is flexible, resilient, and brings an original perspective to the table. In my free time Iâ€™m an avid reader, music collector, and an aspiring yogi.
