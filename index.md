Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nasr.

I am a technology leader with 15+ years of experience in AI, data architecture, and large-scale e-commerce systems. My career spans startups, global enterprises, and multi-million Euro R&D initiatives, where I have built high-impact solutions and led cross-functional teams.

Currently, I serve as Lead Solutions Architect at PUMA Global E-Commerce Engineering, focusing on organizational strategy and cross-team collaboration. I founded Technical Cats of E-Commerce, an initiative driving architectural innovation and technical excellence across teams.

My expertise lies in AI-driven applications, next-gen data architectures, and solving complex technical challenges. I thrive in high-ambiguity environments, balancing rapid experimentation with disciplined execution to turn vision into business impact.

Beyond my corporate role, I have pioneered AI and data-driven projects like MuzeAI, an LLM-powered music recommendation prototype, and The Basin Network, a next-gen data architecture for ML teams. My approach blends deep technical knowledge with strategic leadership to create scalable, future-proof solutions.

To others Iâ€™m known as an enthusiastic person who is flexible, resilient, and innovative. In my free time Iâ€™m a music collector/producer, jogger, and an aspiring yogi.
