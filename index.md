Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nasr.

I'm a dynamic architect, tech lead, and research scientist with a history of guiding successful projects spanning diverse domains (data architecture, AI, robotics, mobile apps, and games) and settings (from agile B2C environments to multiâ€‘million R&D projects). I bring a strategic and creative approach to problemâ€‘solving, coupled with decisive initiative and collaborative empathy which fosters success.

At the intersection of engineering and product leadership, I excel in delivering state-of-the-art solutions that drive business growth and elevate user experiences. Some noteworthy achievements include:

- Leading the design and development of a [data lake SaaS](https://github.com/simutool) for [a aerospace/automotive consortium](https://doi.org/10.3030/680569).

- Inventing a new approach of data architecture & data mesh ([The Basin Network](phd)), resulting in an award of [a PhD](https://fis.uni-bamberg.de/entities/publication/d28b1f7d-1c85-4214-a80f-69ab40d08b60) with distinction and publications ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42486-020-00054-y) [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13222-018-0274-0)).

- Playing a key role in two B2C software products: a mobile game ([Tawla](tw)) and a social network app ([Greetings Studio](gs)).

- Developing Artificial Intelligence players for games and published methods to make robots smarter ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16111-7_14) [[2]](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/6006)).

- Collaborating on an early-stage business venture (intelligent recipe service) with millions in potential users, and developing an open-source music management tool ([Guestrrday](https://github.com/n42r/guestrrday/)).


In my previous roles, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in developing innovative technologies, empathetic agile leadership, and cross-functional collaboration.

Iâ€™m experienced at designing cloud-native system architectures (stateless nodes, ...). My technical proficiencies include Python, Linux CLI, Docker, MongoDB, Neo4j, MySQL, and Google Firebase Cloud.

In my free time Iâ€™m an avid reader, (20th century) music history buff, and an aspiring yogi. To others Iâ€™m known as an enthusiastic person who is flexible, resilient, and brings an original perspective to the table.
