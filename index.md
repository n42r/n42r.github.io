Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nasr.

I'm a dynamic architect and technology lead with a history of guiding successful projects spanning diverse domains (data architecture, social networks, mobile apps, games, robotics, and AI), team sizes (2 to 10), and settings (from agile B2C environments to R&D projects backed by millions of Euros in public funding). 

At the intersection of engineering and product leadership, I excel in delivering state-of-the-art solutions that drive business growth and elevate user experiences. Some noteworthy achievements include:

- Leading the development of a data lake SaaS ([SIMUTOOL Data Lake](https://github.com/simutool)) for a [EU project](https://doi.org/10.3030/680569) of 8 manufacturing companies, cutting turnover time by 30% through streamlining data-driven cooperation.
- Inventing a new approach for data cataloging & exchange ([The Basin Network](phd)), resulting in an award of [a PhD](https://fis.uni-bamberg.de/entities/publication/d28b1f7d-1c85-4214-a80f-69ab40d08b60) with distinction and publications ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42486-020-00054-y) [[2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13222-018-0274-0)).
- Playing a key role in two B2C software products: a mobile game ([Tawla](tw)) whose ratings I helped elevate from 3 to 4.5/5 stars and a social network ([Greetings Studio](gs)) of which I drove its vision through a 10-fold growth in user base.
- Building new methods to make robots smarter ([[1]](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-16111-7_14) [[2]](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/volumearticle/6006)), as well as developing Artificial Intelligence players for games.
- Collaborating on an early-stage business venture (intelligent recipe service) with millions in potential users, and developing an open-source music management tool ([Guestrrday](https://github.com/n42r/guestrrday/)).

In my previous roles, such as Research Associate at the University of Bamberg and Team Leader at TayaIT, I've honed my skills in developing innovative technologies, empathetic agile leadership, and cross-functional collaboration. 

I'm experienced at designing cloud-native system architectures (stateless nodes, docker containers, HTTP API interfaces). My technical proficiencies include Python, Flask, WSGI, Linux CLI, Docker, MongoDB, Neo4j, MySQL, Google Firebase Cloud, and RDF/Semantic Data.

A strategic and critical thinker with a 'no-nonsense' approach and an eye at recognizing patterns, I'm adept at making decisions under uncertainty and leading initiatives. I revel in being part of teams that are larger than the sum of their parts. To others I'm known as an enthusiastic and resilient person who brings an original perspective to the table.

In my free time I'm an avid reader, music history buff, and an aspiring yogi.
